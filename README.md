# Helpcenter

This app was created with Bootify.io - tips on working with the code [can be found here](https://bootify.io/next-steps/).

## Development

During development it is recommended to use the profile `local`. In IntelliJ `-Dspring.profiles.active=local` can be added in the VM options of the Run Configuration after enabling this property in "Modify options". Create your own `application-local.yml` file to override settings for development.

After starting the application it is accessible under `localhost:8080`.

## Build

The application can be built using the following command:

```
gradlew clean build
```

Start your application with the following command - here with the profile `production`:

```
java -Dspring.profiles.active=production -jar ./build/libs/helpcenter-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

If required, a Docker image can be created with the Spring Boot plugin. Add `SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=production` as environment variable when running the container.

```
gradlew bootBuildImage --imageName=io.bootify/helpcenter
```
